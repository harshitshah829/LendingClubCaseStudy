Project Overview

Problem Statement
A consumer finance company focusing on urban lending receives a high volume of loan applications and needs to determine which ones to approve based on the applicantâ€™s profile. The company faces two primary risks with these applications:

Risk A: If an applicant likely to repay is denied a loan, the company misses out on potential business.
Risk B: If an applicant likely to default is approved, the company may incur financial losses.
Risk Scenarios:
When a loan is approved, three outcomes are possible:

Fully Paid: The applicant repays the loan completely, covering both the principal and the interest.
Current: The applicant is actively repaying the loan, and the term is ongoing. These loans are not classified as defaults.
Charged-off: The applicant has defaulted, meaning they have failed to make payments over a significant period.
If a loan application is rejected due to the applicant not meeting the criteria, there is no transaction history available for these cases.

Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key factors that predict loan defaults. This analysis will aid the company in managing its portfolio and assessing risks more effectively.
